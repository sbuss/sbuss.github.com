<p>I am a software developer at Amazon.com on the browse relevance team. I work on the left-hand navigation for search pages, trying to present relevant category results to users. Most recently, I added international support and built out our service worldwide.</p>
<p>I work on a couple projects in my spare time, some of which are on <a href="http://github.com/sbuss/" title="Steven Buss github">github</a>. None of my personal projects are in any way affiliated with Amazon.com.</p>
<p>I'm interested in free speech, data mining, machine learning, and open source.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>I did some research on the construction of a large scale recommender system for social networks in college. This involved mining data from a large social news website and then applying PCA/LSI/etc. You can see some of my matrices in the <a href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/matrices/Buss/">UF Sparse Matrix Collection</a>.</p>
