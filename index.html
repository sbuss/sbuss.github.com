<p>I am a software developer at a stealth biotech startup in the San Francisco
Bay Area. We are growing rapidly and actively improving humanity.</p>

<p>I used to be a software developer at Amazon.com on the browse relevance
team. I worked on the left-hand navigation for search pages, trying to present
relevant category results to users.</p>

<p>While at Amazon I internationalized our service, expanding from only the US
market to Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, and
China; developed a system to determine if a user's search was specific or
generic and tailor our results accordingly; participated heavily in hiring;
and mentored one intern and two new hires. I left because I was bored and
unchallenged.</p>

<p>I work on a few projects in my spare time, which can all be found on
<a href="http://github.com/sbuss/" title="Steven Buss github">github</a>.</p>

<p>I'm interested in free speech, data mining, machine learning, and open
source.</p>

<p>Everyone working in the insurance billing industry claims that billing
can't be automated. I prove them a little more wrong every day.</p>

<p>Sadly on the back-burner due to time constraints. Revisionews is a project

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>I did some research on the construction of a large scale recommender system 
for social networks in college. This involved mining data from a large social 
news website and then applying PCA/LSI/etc. You can see some of my matrices 
in the <a href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/matrices/Buss/">
    UF Sparse Matrix Collection</a>.</p>
<p>Some C code to do Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing can be found on
<a href="https://github.com/sbuss/cs_plsi" title="sparse plsi matlab">
    my cs_plsi github repo</a>.</p>
